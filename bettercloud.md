<p>Bettercloud was going to be starting a redesign of their app to create a modular and cohesive look. The redesign would be a huge project and needed extensive planning.</p>
<br />

<br />
<p>The first phase of the redesign would be creating a new look and feel for the product. I worked with the marketing team and the UX team to create a new theme and design. We decided to use a Bootstrap framework and the lead architects would use the HTML and CSS to create javascript modules. 
<h2>Responsibilities</h2>
<p>Creating a live styleguide for the new site redesign that can easily be updated and modified using Wordpress.</p>
<h4>Tasks</h4>
<ul>
<li>Removing Bootstrap styles and creating a unique look and feel for the new redesign.</li>
<li>Working with the UX team and marketing team to create a new style for the app redesign.</li>
<li>Breaking down the styles into modules consistent with interactions that already occured inside the app.</li>
<li>Creating new icons and webfont consistent with the redesign.</li>
</ul>
